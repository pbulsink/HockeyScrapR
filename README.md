This is a package to simplify getting data from assorted websites including HockeyReference.com, QuantHockey.com, and Dailyfaceoff.com. 

Please respect these websites with your scraping rate, and credit them for the data you use. 

Install these tools in R using `devtools`:

```R
install.packages('devtools')

devtools::install_github(pbulsink/HockeyScrapR)
```
